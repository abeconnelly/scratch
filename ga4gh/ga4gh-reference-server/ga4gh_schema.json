The different enumerated values\nhave the following usage:\n\n* `ALIGNMENT_MATCH`: An alignment match indicates that a sequence can be\n  aligned to the reference without evidence of an INDEL. Unlike the\n  `SEQUENCE_MATCH` and `SEQUENCE_MISMATCH` operators, the `ALIGNMENT_MATCH`\n  operator does not indicate whether the reference and read sequences are an\n  exact match. This operator is equivalent to SAM's `M`.\n* `INSERT`: The insert operator indicates that the read contains evidence of\n  bases being inserted into the reference. This operator is equivalent to\n  SAM's `I`.\n* `DELETE`: The delete operator indicates that the read contains evidence of\n  bases being deleted from the reference. This operator is equivalent to\n  SAM's `D`.\n* `SKIP`: The skip operator indicates that this read skips a long segment of\n  the reference, but the bases have not been deleted. This operator is\n  commonly used when working with RNA-seq data, where reads may skip long\n  segments of the reference between exons. This operator is equivalent to\n  SAM's 'N'.\n* `CLIP_SOFT`: The soft clip operator indicates that bases at the start/end\n  of a read have not been considered during alignment. This may occur if the\n  majority of a read maps, except for low quality bases at the start/end of\n  a read. This operator is equivalent to SAM's 'S'. Bases that are soft clipped\n  will still be stored in the read.\n* `CLIP_HARD`: The hard clip operator indicates that bases at the start/end of\n  a read have been omitted from this alignment. This may occur if this linear\n  alignment is part of a chimeric alignment, or if the read has been trimmed\n  (e.g., during error correction, or to trim poly-A tails for RNA-seq). This\n  operator is equivalent to SAM's 'H'.\n* `PAD`: The pad operator indicates that there is padding in an alignment.\n  This operator is equivalent to SAM's 'P'.\n* `SEQUENCE_MATCH`: This operator indicates that this portion of the aligned\n  sequence exactly matches the reference (e.g., all bases are equal to the\n  reference bases). This operator is equivalent to SAM's '='.\n* `SEQUENCE_MISMATCH`: This operator indicates that this portion of the\n  aligned sequence is an alignment match to the reference, but a sequence\n  mismatch (e.g., the bases are not equal to the reference). This can\n  indicate a SNP or a read error. This operator is equivalent to SAM's 'X'.",
