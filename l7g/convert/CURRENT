```
./convert-gff-pgp-all
```

This misses a few chrM because it's either not in the GFF (because
it wasn't converted from the CGI-Var correctly) or an alternate
chrM was used (from okg).  To handle these (about 40 in total),
the lists of each are in:

```
alt_chrM.list
empty-chrm-pgp.list
```

and the scripts that use them:

```
convert-cgivar-pgp-chrm
convert-gff-mt
```
