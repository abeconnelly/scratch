There were quite a few files that had chrM problems, wither
using a different referece file (e.g. from okg) or had
some other issue.  There were also some errors in how
these were generted with the conversion utilities (pasta),
sometimes omitting the startTag and endTag.  While the
startTag and endTag omissions weren't technically needed
as they were only omitted for start and end tiles,
these are kind of a 'nice to have' as it makes the dataset
homogenious.

These can still be converted but need special consideration.

The offending datasets are collected here.

It looks like these were the 20 that had the alternate chrM
(that is, MT) chromosome referenced against the okg MT reference.
