This takes in the reference stream and creates FastJ from it.
It's a lot simpler since there's no alignment or no calls,
so you can use `a2fj` directly.  `a2fj` does a straight
string match for tags within the sequence and emits tiles
when it finds them.  By knowing which tags are skipped
the seed tile length can be calculated.

This is a sort of general method in that any stream
will work and tile properly except for the 'no-calls'.
Maybe the more general implementation is to stream in a
pasta stream so that you can pick out when you hit a tag
that happens to have no-calls on it.
sFfor now this is quick and dirty and creates
the FastJ for hg19 nicely.

`a2fj` was also used for tiling missing chrM in
some of the PGP GFF data.
