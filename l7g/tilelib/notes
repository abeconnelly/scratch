Start to create some tile library scripts.

The keep mount is slow and failing so I'm using
`arv-get` to collect the relevant FastJ files for
library creation.  The mapping of id to portable
data hash is `id_pdh.tsv` (tab delimited).

The `./run_cglf_single.sh` collects the FastJ
files into the data directory, runs fastj2cgflib
then deletes the corresponding files.

Download through this method takes about ~2mins.
fastj2cgflib looks to be pretty variable but it's
probably in the range of 5-15mins.

The `./run_cglf_all.sh` uses `xargs` to parallelize
the operation (15 at a time).

The final sglf files are in the `lib` subdirectory.


Quick Start
---

```
time ./run_cglf_all.sh 2> all.err | tee all.log
```

This will put data in `lib` and use `data`.
